# Hi, my name is Diogo Barbosa and:

I don't have a specific tech stack, I just use my programming skills to solve problems by developing robust solutions with the technology that best fits to the problem.
<br/>
# My Motto is:

## **Every day:**

**<ins>Dream,</ins>** **<ins>Think,</ins>** **<ins>Learn,</ins>** **<ins>Grow,</ins>** **<ins>Fight,</ins>** **<ins>Chase and Execute your goals,</ins>**

**because...**

## **Stopping is dying**
